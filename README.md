# JEST Test Runner

This Glitch runs any Jest tests found in `src`.

When you browse to the served webpage, you'll see your test results pretty-printed in the browser.

It's designed to be a sandbox for doing TDD, and TDD demos on Glitch.

# Usage

Just remix this and put your own code in here!

# Credits

Pretty output thanks to npm: `jest-html-reporter`.
